## Super Agreements

Super Agreements are the additional value transfer functionality that Super Tokens have. When an account engages in a Super Agreement with another account, it agrees to have its Super Token balance modified according to the rules of the agreement and chosen parameters. Currently, there are two available Super Agreements: the Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) and the Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA).

The CFA is what lets you stream money, so let's talk about it!

## Calculating Balances with the CFA

Let's say your driving a car that's going 1 km per minute. If 13 minutes pass, then you would have travelled 1 km/min. * 13 min. = **13 miles**.

Now similarly, if you are streaming at a rate of 1 DAIx per second and 13 seconds pass, then you would have moved 1 DAIx/sec. * 13 min. = **13 DAI**.

With each passing second, the amount of DAIx you've moved changes to 14, to 15, and so on.

So that's all the CFA is doing; adding a *rate* component to balance calculation.

To put this mathematically, you can call the amount of DAIx you originally had as your "static balance" and then the amount you've streamed out as the "real-time balance" delta and by combining the two, you get your actual balance!

```
POV: You are streaming to someone at a rate of 1 DAIx per second and 13 seconds have passed since you started the stream.

Static Balance    = 100 DAIx
Real-Time Balance = -13 DAIx = -1 DAIx/sec * 13 seconds passed
                    --------
Actual Balance    =  87 DAIx = 100 + -13
```

Last thing to note, is that the real-time balance is accounted in the CFA's own contract. When you go to view your balance on the `balanceOf` function on the Super Token, we've overriden it to take your basic static balance and then add the real-time balance.

## Question

True or False? Superfluid submits transactions every second to update my balance when I start a stream.
- True: Superfluid spends a lot on gas!
- False: You're really just reading the value off a formula in the `balanceOf()` function which uses time as a variable

You have 200 SUNNYx in your wallet. You start a stream to someone at a rate of 5 SUNNYx per second and then 20 seconds pass. You open your Metamask (which uses `balanceOf()` to display your balance). How much SUNNYx do you have?
- 200 SUNNYx
- 100 SUNNYx
- 0 SUNNYx
- 300 SUNNYx
