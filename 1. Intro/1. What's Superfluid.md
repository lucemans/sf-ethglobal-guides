# What is Superfluid?

The way we usually move tokens on-chain is through basic ERC20 transfers. I transfer you 100 DAI and my balance goes down 100 and yours goes up 100.

Superfluid's smart contract framework takes this a step forward by introducing a new token standard, called the Super Token. The Super Token extends the basic ERC20 transfer functionality to include Super Agreements. These Super Agreements give us new and more powerful ways to move tokens on-chain!

The most popular Super Agreement lets us *stream* Super Tokens - it's called the Constant Flow Agreement (CFA). We also provide another Super Agreement called the Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA) which lets you do scalable one-to-many distributions. This guide is going to focus on money streaming with the CFA.
