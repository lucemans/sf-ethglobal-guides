# Use Cases and Ideas

Let's discuss some of the major use cases areas of composable money streaming. You'll walk away from this page with a better understanding of why money streaming important and how you can use it.

## Recurring Payment

Because transactions typically move value in a one-and-done fashion, on-chain recurring payments become manual and less scalable. Superfluid money streams solve this by allowing us to perpetually and automatically move value between accounts. This lets us realize many automatic recurring payment use cases!

**Use Cases**
- [Automated Real-Time Payroll](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/recurring-payment#salary-streams)
- [On-chain Subscriptions](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/recurring-payment#subscriptions)
- [Insurance Premium Payments](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/recurring-payment#premium-payments)
- [Rentals](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/recurring-payment#rentals)

## DeFi

We typically experience DeFi with discrete lump sum transfers. For instance, I swap 100 DAI or I deposit 0.5 ETH - those actions are one-and-done. With Superfluid streams, you can replace these one-time interactions with automatic continual token streams.

**Use Cases**
- [Dollar-Cost Average Automatically and In Real-Time](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/defi#dollar-cost-averaging)
- [Automate Personal or Business Savings](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/defi#dollar-cost-averaging)
- [Undercollateralized Lending](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/defi#undercollateralized-lending)
- [Lending/Borrowing/Repayment In Streams](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/defi#lending-in-streams)
- [Streaming Perpetual Options](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/use-cases/defi#streaming-options)

## Social & Community
