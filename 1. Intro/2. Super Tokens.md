# What are Super Tokens?

The Super Token is our extension of the ERC20 token standard that plugs into the Superfluid Protocol to include Super Agreement abilities. These Super Agreements allow Super Tokens to be transferred in powerful ways such as in streams or instant distributions. Keep in mind that Super Tokens can do everything that a traditional ERC20 token can PLUS new modes of value transfer enabled by Superfluid (i.e., money streaming).

Super Tokens come in two forms: wrapper and custom. Wrapper Super Tokens are the most common, so let's discuss them. If you'd like to understand the rarer Custom Super Token, head over [here](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/protocol-overview/in-depth-overview/super-tokens#custom).

## Wrapper Super Tokens

A wrapper Super Token is an existing ERC20 token that's been "wrapped" into a Super Token to gain Super Agreement functionality.

### Wrapping and Unwrapping

When getting Wrapper Super Tokens, you first use the `upgrade(uint256 amount)` function on the Wrapper Super Token contract. This takes the desired amount of the Wrapper Super Token's underlying ERC20 token from your wallet and mints you an equal amount of Wrapper Super Tokens. Basically, you gave up the plain underlying ERC20 token and got the "Super Token version" of it. 

Say you want to go back from Wrapper Super Tokens to the underlying ERC20 token. You would simply unwrap the desired amount with the `downgrade(uint256 amount)` function and the opposite happens; the desired amount of your Super Tokens are burned and an equal amount of the underlying ERC20 token are returned to you.

The naming convention for Wrapper Super Tokens is the original token symbol + "x" (so USDC âž¡ USDCx)

## Question

How do you go from plain DAI to DAIx?
- Approve DAIx to spend my DAI and then call upgrade on the DAIx contract with the amount of DAI I want to wrap into DAIx.
- Approve DAI to spend my DAIx and then call upgrade on the DAIx contract with the amount of DAI I want to wrap into DAIx.
- Approve DAI to spend my DAIx and then call downgrade on the DAI contract with the amount of DAI I want to wrap into DAIx.
- Approve DAIx to spend my DAI and then call downgrade on the DAI contract with the amount of DAI I want to wrap into DAIx.
