# Streaming Money in Solidity

[Docs Reference Page](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/solidity-libraries/cfav1-library)

So you've seen how easy it is to stream straight from your EOA account (your plain personal wallet) using the SDK Core. Now, say you want to create a smart contract that will be able to stream tokens on its own. 

You've probably seen a contract transfer ERC20 tokens on its own with the transfer function ðŸ‘‡

```
IERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(receiverAddress, amountToTransfer);
```

Well, here's the equivalent for a contract streaming Super Tokens on its own ðŸ‘‡ It's not rocket science!

```
cfaV1.createFlow(receiverAddress, superToken, perSecondflowRate);
```

However, there is some set up needed before hand in order for your contract to begin streaming money like that - read on!

# Basic Example - FlowSender Contract

To illustrate how a contract can send money in streams, we'll use a simple contract which we'll call the FlowSender. Basically, FlowSender is going to fund itself with DAIx and be able to create, update, and delete streams to addresses of our choosing.
