# Streaming Money in Solidity

So you've seen how easy it is to stream straight from your EOA account (your plain personal wallet) using the SDK Core. Now, say you want to create a smart contract that will be able to stream tokens on its own. 

You've probably seen a contract transfer ERC20 tokens on its own with the transfer function ðŸ‘‡

```
IERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(receiverAddress, amountToTransfer);
```

Well, here's the equivalent for a contract streaming Super Tokens on its own ðŸ‘‡ It's not rocket science!

```
cfaV1.createFlow(receiverAddress, superToken, perSecondflowRate);
```

However, there is some set up needed before hand in order for your contract to begin streaming money like that - read on!
